Supplementary materials, source codes of algorithms and datasets for our paper
"High-probability Kernel Alignment Regret Bounds for Online Kernel Selection",
accepted in ECML2021.

We implement all algorithms with R on a Windows machine with 2.5 GHz Core i7 CPU, 
execute each experiment 10 times with random permutation of all datasets and average all of the results.

The baseline algorithms include: BOGD, Forgetron, OKS and ISKA.
Our algorithms include: B(AO)2KS, EA2OKS and BEA2OKS.
